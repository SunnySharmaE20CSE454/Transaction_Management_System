# Transaction_Management_System

Our data architecture comprises three interconnected databases designed using SQL, encompassing records for personal information, branch details, and city information. PL SQL serves as the backbone of our transaction system, where users are prompted to input their account number and preferred transaction option. Based on the user's input, various transactions are executed. To conclude, the system displays the user's updated current balance, ensuring that this information is seamlessly integrated and reflected within our database.
